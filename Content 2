We Care Nepal is a non profit organisation  established on the year 2020 by a group of 
young based in East part of Nepal - Dharan and Registered on 2021. 
It aims to bring together the youth who are passionate about helping those in desperate need, 
however, may have held back due to absence of direction and support that they required to move forward. 
We believe that "helping you" is one of the many platforms which will enable these passionate individuals
to utilise their god given talents/skills and their passion to make a positive difference in the society
where they were born , where they grew up and where they have resided in.
